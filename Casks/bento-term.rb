# Homebrew cask for the Bento Term Mac app.
#
#   brew install --cask NovaShang/tap/bento-term
#
# A cask, not a formula: this ships a GUI .app bundle, which Homebrew wants
# staged into /Applications rather than symlinked into a bin. The old
# `bento-terminal` formula in NovaShang/bento installed a Go daemon + CLI
# that was deleted on 2026-08-01 — this supersedes it, it is not a rename.
#
# `version` and `sha256` are rewritten by the "Update cask" step in
# NovaShang/BentoTerm's .github/workflows/release.yml after each tagged
# release. Do not hand-edit them; edit that workflow if artifact naming
# changes.
